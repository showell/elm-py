emit:
    focus on can-it-run:
        need to extract vars from case patterns
            left = res.val['left']
            right = res.val['right']

        need to wrap [] with toElm or use List.empty

        from Order import GT, LT, EQ
        from Basics import compare
        import List

        (need to get actual import working)
        move GT to Basics? or just do prelude to match Elm semantically?

    misc:
        distinguish Type at front vs. nested
