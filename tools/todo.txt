emit:
    focus on can-it-run:
        (need to get actual import working)
        move GT to Basics? or just do prelude to match Elm semantically?

    keep trying to simplify pattern parsing

    misc:
        distinguish Type at front vs. nested

    cleanup:
        add annotations
        yapf
